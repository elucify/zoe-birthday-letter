# Letter to Zoe Johnson

The day of her birth.

July 28th 2004

My dearest Zoe,

As I write this, you are just under 15 hours old. This morning I saw you for the first
time and touched you for the first time. You looked confused. You were squirming, and
yelling and coughing. Learning to breathe.

Right now, as I write this, I am eating leftover Ethiopian food - the leftovers from the
dinner your uncle Eric and I were eating last night when your mother called me to say
she was in labor. Right now you are sleeping (I imagine) in the nursery at GWU hospital,
and the nurses are taking care of your every need - and bringing you to your mommy to
nurse when you need to.

Zoe, you'll never be able to imagine, unless or until you have children of your own, how
much I love you. I couldn't believe my eyes this morning when I first saw your face.
I've only just said my first hello to you, and now I'm writing my first goodbye.

Because, God willing, right now it's your 18th birthday, and you're a young woman, and
soon you'll be off on your own to practice the love your mama and I passed on to you.

Right now, you're a squirming newborn, barely able to focus her eyes. And right now,
you're my beautiful, grown-up Zoe, of whom I could not be more proud. I have more faith
in this than you can imagine. It's a statement of faith for me that I write these
words - to tell you I love you and always will, until I die and, God willing,
afterwards.

Your mother was so brave and so beautiful this morning, Zoe. She was afraid, but went
through it with love for you and me. Zoe, your mother is one of the most profoundly good
people I've ever known. I am honored to be loved by her, and to have been chosen by her
to bring a new life - your life - into this terrible, beautiful, and mysterious World.

My dearest child, my love, go be happy. Make others happy. Use the strength and clarity
you got from your mother and the other strength and sensitivity you got from me, and the
intelligence and heart you got from both of us, and all of these things as the gifts
from God that they are. Be joy, Zoe. And remember that your mother and I love you as we
love life itself, and nothing you ever do can ever change that, except to deepen it.

Happy birthday.

Love, Dad  
age 42, and age 60
